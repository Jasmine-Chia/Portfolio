# Google-Data-Analytics-Cyclistic-Case-Study

## Premise and Scenario
In this case study, the role assigned to me is a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 

**The goal of the case study is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently**, and from there design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members as the director believes that the success of the company depends on maximising the number of annual memberships as annual members are more profitable than casual riders.

For context, casual riders are customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes; while member riders are customers who purchase annual memberships.
